# SDLC-Program

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

By being able to have a discussion with them to gain full clarity of what is being asked and what will be required for the finished product. With a discussion I am able to understand a users needs through creating a rapport with them and allowing myself to understand what they are looking for. While also being able to throw suggestions to further help them with creating a product. With creating user stories, by understanding what the end user wants. I am able to keep full transparency with them and my team, by being able to address timelines, amount of effort needed, and changes that would be made.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs, by first outlining what is asked. Either through a flow chart or diagram to allow myself to picture what I will be doing before I start developing code. The agile processes I want to incorporate on future development work are Scrum and Kanban. As they are both very beneficial when developing code to me. Scrum and Kanban both have a strong sense of collaboration and feedback. While also creating a daily meeting to ensure that tasks are met. And ensuring that I understand how much "work" is needed for each task during a sprint. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me being a good team member is someone that is reliable, dependable and knowledgeable. Being able to help my other team members when they are struggling. Creating a strong bond between me and them, while also maintaining a positive environment. Dependable by being able to stay late or take on more tasks if needed by the team. To ensure that we all succeed and complete our future projects together. And finally knowledgeable, by being able to share any knowledge that I have that may be useful for someone. For example, if I experience something that someone else has not, I would want to share my information to be able to help them out.
